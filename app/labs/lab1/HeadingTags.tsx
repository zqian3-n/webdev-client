          Text documents are often broken up into several sections and
          subsections. Each section is usually prefaced with a short title or
          heading that attempts to summarize the topic of the section it
          precedes. For instance this paragraph is preceded by the heading
          Heading Tags. The font of the section headings are usually larger and
          bolder than their subsection headings. This document uses headings to
          introduce topics such as HTML Documents, HTML Tags, Heading Tags, etc.
          HTML heading tags can be used to format plain text so that it renders
          in a browser as large headings. There are 6 heading tags for different
          sizes: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. Tag h1 is the largest heading and
          h6 is the smallest heading.{" "}
